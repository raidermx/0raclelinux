System Requirements
Verify that your system fulfills the following minimum requirements. In general, having more
resources in the system improves a system's performance.
• Minimum of 2 logical CPUs up to 2048 logical CPUs
• 1.5 GB of memory per logical CPU, up to a maximum of 64 TB
• At least 10 GB of disk space (20 GB is the recommended minimum)
• On UEFI systems, ensure that the target disk uses GPT (GUID Partition Table), as some
UEFI firmwares do not support UEFI/MBR boot
