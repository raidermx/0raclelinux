Installing the 64-Bit JDK on RPM-Based Linux Platforms
You can install the JDK on 64-bit RPM-based Linux platforms, such as Red Hat and
SuSE by using a downloadable RPM package file (.rpm ) in the system location.
Note:
You can install the JDK using a downloadable RPM package file on an OL
system too, but the preferred way to install the JDK on OL systems is from
Oracle Linux RPM repositories.
Ensure that you have the root user access. You can do this by running the command
su and entering the superuser password.
To install the 64-bit JDK on an RPM-based Linux platform:
1. Download the required file:
• For x64 systems: jdk-20.interim.update.patch_linux-x64_bin.rpm . For
example, jdk-20_linux-x64_bin.rpm
• For aarch64 (64-bit ARM) systems: jdk-20.interim.update.patch_linux-
aarch64_bin.rpm . For example, jdk-20_linux-aarch64_bin.rpm
Before you download a file, you must accept the license agreement.
2. Install the required package using the following command:
$ sudo rpm -ivh jdk-20_linux-x64_bin.rpm
OR
$ sudo rpm -ivh jdk-20_linux-aarch64_bin.rpm
Upgrade the required package using the following command:
$ sudo rpm -Uvh jdk-20_linux-x64_bin.rpm
OR
$ sudo rpm -Uvh jdk-20_linux-aarch64_bin.rpm
Note:
JDK 20 can coexist with other feature releases of JDK. For each feature
release, a separate directory is created, the default directory
being /usr/lib/jvm/jdk-<FEATURE>-oracle-<ARCH> . For example, JDK
20 releases for x64 will be installed in /usr/lib/jvm/jdk-20-oracle-x64
directory.
3. Delete the .rpm file if you want to save disk space.
It is not required to reboot.
