firewalld

sudo systemctl status firewalld

sudo firewall-cmd --list-all --zone=work

sudo firewall-cmd --list-services --zone=work
cockpit dhcpv6-client ssh

To allow access to a new service, use the --add-service service option. Optionally, include the --permanent option to make the rule persistent across reboots.

For example, to add the HTTP and NFS services to the work zone, you would use the following command:



sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=work --add-service=http --add-service=nfs
sudo firewall-cmd --list-services --zone=work
cockpit dhcpv6-client ssh http nfs

To remove access to a service, use the --remove-service service option:



sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=work --remove-service=cockpit
sudo firewall-cmd --list-services --zone=work 
dhcpv6-client ssh http nfs


To start the service:


sudo systemctl unmask firewalld


sudo systemctl start firewalld


To ensure that the service starts automatically when the system starts, run the following command after starting the firewall:

sudo systemctl enable firewalld

To stop the firewall service and prevent it from automatically starting when the system starts, run the following command:


sudo systemctl stop firewalld


sudo systemctl disable firewalld

To prevent the firewall service from being started by other services or through the firewalld D-Bus interface, run the following command after disabling the firewall:


sudo systemctl mask firewalld

To display the current status of the firewall service:


sudo systemctl status firewalld
