Installing Python on Oracle Linux 9

Oracle Linux 9 includes the concept of Application Streams, where multiple versions of user-space components 
can be delivered and updated more frequently than the core operating system packages in RPM format or groups 
of related RPMs called Modules. The initial release of Oracle Linux 9 includes Python 3.9 as the full lifecycle 
Python release; further python release may be released as AppStream Modules in the future.

To install and run Python 3.9:
$ sudo dnf install python3
$ python

To create a virtual environment using venv:
$ python -m venv py39env
$ source py39env/bin/activate
